I have a significant obsession with lip balms. I always have at least one lip item on my person, and I significantly love shopping for lip care items. I think this behavior is trackable to a childhood affliction of terrible chapped lips:

In any case, I have been wanting to do a cool data vis project for awhile, but was less than inspired by the excellent datasets available on the internet. So I thought about the stuff in my life that comprises the most datapoints, and lip balms were a frivolous but obvious choice.

So I set out to find all my lip products. I have limited this experiment to non-colored lip balms and treatments, so no lipstick or anything with color. Even with that limitation, the dataset was rich:
!image

I then worked up a spreadsheet of all this stuff with very not-empirical data. The grading of lip balms along three axes (100% sticky being like having honey or gloopy lip gloss on your mouth, 100% waxy as rubbing your mouth with a candle, and 100% oily as using some olive oil for lip balm) is quite subjective. And the pricing information is subject to change, and I am unlikely to keep it updated.

I calculated the x, y coordinates so that they might make a nice triangle when plotted thusly:

Next I went looking for some library help to make a nice graph with attractive colors and tooltips and such to make the most of my data. I ended up using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) for my visualization needs.
