I've been doing Ludum Dare game jams for some time...

And I'm really proud of my streak.

I've always worked as the artist/UI/concept/writer-type person with a programmer (@johnicholas), so this was my first LD experience doing some of the coding.

I also did a lot of the visual elements, writing, and audio, but since the vast majority of the text in the game is procedurally generated using the fabulous tracery library by @galaxykate, I spent a good deal of time coding, revising code the programmer wrote, and tweaking things to get them working right. I feel like I've learned a ton about Javascript from working so closely on code for a project I designed with a more experienced programmer.

This was the first time doing the Jam that I really felt the time crunch, and we submitted with just twelve minutes to spare. As such, a number of features got cut (mostly for the best), and a few bugs remain (boo). But, I think it's neat and the procedural text makes me laugh, and the style and art came along nicely in 72 hours.
