Well, I have not done much computing in the last month. My attention has been diverted by uprooting my life, leaving my job, and moving to New York City from Maine. I have been here in NYC about two weeks now, and I am loving it.

I have been grinding through some Python programming, finishing up the material and exercises in Python the Hard Way (Shaw) and Python for Informatics (Severance). I have also enrolled in a Coursera course I have taken a few times before, Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python. I've taken the course twice before, and have not quite been able to complete it, but on this attempt, I'm less distracted and have a lot more time as I'm not currently working. I previously very much enjoyed the weekly schedule of little games and the amazingly cool CodeSkulptor web compiling tool.
