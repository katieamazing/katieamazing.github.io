title: "Ludum Dare 38 Jam Entry"

Once again, I participated in the Ludum Dare game jam. I joined the "jam" category, which means I could work with a partner ([@Johnicholas](https://twitter.com/Johnicholas)), and have an extra day. So, a game in 72 hours. Except, a catch: I was at a conference all day Saturday, so really more like 48 hours of active time!

We interpreted the theme of **a small world** in a pretty typical way, and came up with **Whirled of Words**, a voice-controlled element balancing game. You can play it [here](https://katieamazing.com/games/LD38/).

If you also participated in Ludum Dare this time around, you can make my day: [leave me a comment and rate the game at the website.](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/whirled-of-words-1) Thank you!



The most pleasing thing for me was how this entry tied together many of my educational efforts over the last weeks and months.

I had recently completed a [JavaScript game](http://katieamazing.com/blog/2017/02/24/moon-sugar) that went pretty well, and that I did very little visual art for. I ran with that for this Ludum Dare. I had a conference to attend from 8am-5pm on Friday and Saturday, so I knew I would have less time than usual, even doing the 72-hour Jam. So choosing to stay out of Photoshop was a time-saving and energy-saving step that really worked out.

I used SVG for the first time ever (!) to do all the graphics. A few days before, I randomly spent a couple hours at the Recurse Center pairing with a batchmate who was exploring SVG for the first time. I did this without Ludum Dare in mind, but I used a lot of the orientation to SVG I got during that pairing to make the game. I used Inkscape to generate the SVG code for the sprites.

We used vanilla JavaScript to do all of the coding. Back in January when I was doing Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, I was inspired by the demonstration of the built-in browser support for voice recognition. I held onto that inspiration for the next Ludum Dare. This is the first time a commitment to a specific technology/technique before the theme announcement has not bitten me in the ass during the Ludum weekend. I was really pleased with the scope, complexity, and flexibility of using JavaScript and voice recognition.

As always, there are things that didn't go as planned. 
  * I had hoped to do more physics animation of the SVG elements. I looked into some libraries to do this, but we ended up not having time to implement very much extra. 
  * Just ran out of time on UI/background polishing stuff. It is functional, but I think it could be cooler.
  * We didn't add any sound at all - this was semi-intentional, as we imagined that adding sound effects and music might interfere with the voice recognition, but I still missed doing it. Sound really adds a lot to a game! 
  * And finally, submitting to this particular LD was a stressful nightmare. The Ludum Dare site is still significantly under construction, and that was really unpleasant to deal with after a long day of work on the game.

But we did it! Yay LD38, another one for my memory books!
