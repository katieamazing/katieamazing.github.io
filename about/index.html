  <p>I'm a polyglot programmer living in NYC. In 2016, I started teaching myself to program, and used this blog to document the most outwardly-interesting things I was working on. I am excited about game jams. In 2017, I spent a terrific spring at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
  <p>In 2018, I started working as a technical writer in the fintech space, and have enjoyed building documentation and classes to support developers. I've also leveled up at Software Reliability Engineering skills, including observability, user support, and platform management.</p>

	  <p>When I'm not coding, I like to <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FNG4AB6eY5Bqg38WbtreN0fwuwA&usp=sharing">travel</a>, eat, and learn about the world from nice people.
