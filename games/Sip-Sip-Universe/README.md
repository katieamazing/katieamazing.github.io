**Sip Sip Universe** is a procedurally-generated astro-exploring ode to wine and the games that inspired us (Nom Nom Galaxy, The Sims winemaking, No Man's Sky). It features colorful planets to explore, a rainbow of fruits to make into wines, and a Winecellar Between the Worlds where you can stow your most prized bottles, and where others can come to admire your fanciful wines.

Sip Sip Universe was made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 39 Compo.

Post-Jam List:
* [ ] Add roguelike elements
* [X] Enemies
* [X] Combat (good enough...)
* [ ] More fruits, more terrains
* [ ] Ship selector
* [ ] Character selector
* [X] Music
* [ ] General cleanup (fuel, winemaking is messy and could be improved)
