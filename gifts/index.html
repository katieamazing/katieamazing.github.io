    <p>Sometimes the people that love me ask me what I want for my birthday/holidays. Here is a reference guide so I quit saying stuff like "I don't know!".
    
      
     <p>Sometimes, people ask me what I'd like to receive for a holiday. Here are some ideas, which I hope will be helpful. </p><br><br>

<p>I like consumable things that create experiences rather than more stuff.<p>

<ul>
  <li>Unique/specialty <b>condiments</b>, like jams, honeys, salts, peppers, sauces, etc. I don't like pickles, 

    though.</li>
  <li><b>Candles/essential oils</b>, I often burn candles in the cooler months, and use an aroma diffuser regularly, 

    and I like fresh, herbal, and woodsy notes. Please nothing soapy, powdery, or floral.</li>
  <li><b>Fabric</b> always gets used eventually, even though my exact interest in sewing waxes and wanes and 

wends through various hobbies (costuming, quilting, apparel, etc). I strongly prefer 100% natural fibers 

(linen, silk, cotton, wool), and classic/classy patterns or designs.
    <ul><li>1 yard is useful as a quilting fabric or a tank top</li>
<li>2-3 yards is a typical minimum for apparel projects like blouses, button-ups, tank tops, pants, etc., and 

  a good quantity for a quilting project</li>
      <li>4-6 yards is a dress or coat</li>
<li>8-20 yards is sufficient for a costume gown, which rates low on a practicality scale but high on the fun-

to-make-and-wear-for-photos scale. This much fabric in a natural fiber is a generous gift; feel free to 

  check in with me to make sure it's a color or material I will be delighted by.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
